# AdversarialNN
Implementation of Adversarial learning on several neural networks

RNN/LSTM model is implemented by Isaac Caswell (a 2nd year Stanford CS master student)
CNN model is implemented by Allen Nie (1st year Stanford SymSys master student)

Also contributions are from Onkur Sen, our project partner as well.

To learn more about this model (currently only LSTM is working),
our report can be found here:
